        <p class="about_info-parag">
          <strong class="text-highlight">Paramore</strong> is an American rock
          band from Franklin, Tennessee, formed in 2004. The band currently
          consists of lead vocalist Hayley Williams, guitarist Taylor York and
          drummer Zac Farro. Williams and Farro are founding members of the
          group, while York, a high school friend of the original lineup, joined
          in 2007. The band is signed to Fueled by Ramen, a subsidiary of
          Atlantic Records, both owned by Warner Music Group.
        </p>
        <p class="about_info-parag1">
            Williams was separately signed to Atlantic as she was scouted when she was a teenager, and they were the only label to let her stay in the band instead of going solo, but Atlantic said the rest of the band had to sign to Fueled by Ramen. She is also the only member to appear on all five of Paramore's studio albums.

            The group released its debut album, All We Know Is Falling, in 2005, with the album reaching number four on the UK Rock Chart in 2009 and number thirty on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart in 2006.
            
            The band's second album, Riot!, was released in 2007. Thanks to the success of the singles "Misery Business", "Crushcrushcrush", and "That's What You Get", Riot! was a mainstream success and was certified Platinum in the United States. Paramore then received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2008 Grammy Awards. Their 2009 follow-up, Brand New Eyes, is the band's second-highest-charting album to date, landing at number two on the Billboard 200 with 175,000 first-week sales. It produced the top-forty single "The Only Exception" and went platinum in Ireland and the UK, as well as gold in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
            
            Following the departure of Josh and Zac Farro in 2010, the band released their self-titled fourth album in 2013. It gave the band their first number one on the US Billboard 200 and was also the number one album in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. It included the singles "Still Into You" and "Ain't It Fun", with the latter winning the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song for Williams and York as songwriters, making it Paramore's first Grammy Award win. The band's lineup changed once again after this album cycle, with bassist Jeremy Davis leaving the band near the end of 2015 and former drummer Zac Farro rejoining the band in 2017. Their fifth studio album, After Laughter, was released later that year to critical acclaim.
